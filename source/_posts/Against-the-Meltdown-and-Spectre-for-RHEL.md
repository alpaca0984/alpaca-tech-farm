One of the most popular Linux distributions is Red-Hat-Enterprize-Linux(RHEL) including CentOS.
Maybe you use it.

RHEL mentions Spectre and Meltdown in their blog.

For instance, if you use RHEL-7, it's needed to update these packages.
- kernel
- kernel-rt
- libvirt
- qemu-kvm
- dracut

They are provided via yum, so you can update them by this command.
```console
$ sudo yum update kernel kernel-rt libvirt qemu-kvm dracut
```
